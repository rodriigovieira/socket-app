# Live Chat Application

This is a live chat application created with socket.io, using Javascript in the client side and also in the server side (with NodeJS). The application was made as suggested by Andrew Mead in his NodeJS developer course.

This application can be found live at: http://chat.rodrigovieira.work. If you'd rather install it locally, just follow the procedures bellow.

# Installation

First, make sure you have Node installed locally on your machine.

Then, clone the repository locally. Run:

```
git clone https://github.com/rodriigovieira/socket-app.git
```

Then, install all project dependencies. Run:

```
yarn install
```

Done! The project is now completely configured in your machine.

To start it, just run:

```
yarn start
```

And the project will be live at port 3000 by default.
